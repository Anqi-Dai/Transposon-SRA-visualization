# Transposon-SRA-visualization

Transposons are retroviral elements that were inserted into the the human ancestral genome in the distant past. These sequencesare mobile and have been duplicated many times throughout the genome, comprising as much as 45% of the overall humangenome sequence. Retrotransposons (RT), which make up most of the transposons in the human genome, attain mobility bybeing transcribed and reinserted elsewhere through reverse transcription. RT insertion can be highly disruptive, and, perhaps asa consequence, the transcription of these elements is highly suppressed in most healthy cells. The role of RT transcription in thecontext of disease and aging, however, is poorly understood.
